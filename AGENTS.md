# Strix — Agent Guide

Strix is an open-source autonomous AI pentesting tool. This file is for AI coding agents that want to **use** Strix (run security scans) or **contribute** to it.

## Using Strix from an agent

Install the agent skills for step-by-step workflows:

```bash
npx skills add maruthis/strix
```

- `penetration-testing-with-strix` — run a headless pentest against code, URLs, domains, or IPs and read results
- `fix-security-vulnerabilities-with-strix` — remediate findings and re-run Strix to verify
- `ci-security-scanning-with-strix` — add PR scanning to CI/CD

**Self-hosted, one engine:**

```bash
pip install "strix-agent @ git+https://github.com/maruthis/strix"   # install this fork
export STRIX_LLM="openai/gpt-5.4"                 # any LiteLLM model id
export LLM_API_KEY="<key>"
strix -n -t ./ --scan-mode quick --max-budget 10  # headless scan; always use -n
```

- Installing from `git+https://github.com/maruthis/strix` (rather than the upstream
  `strix-agent` PyPI package) is what gets this fork's changes — ref-pinning, the
  `standards`/`vulnerabilities` skill catalog, the `--skill` flag, and the scan-coverage
  determinism work. See [`docs/extending-without-code-changes.md`](docs/extending-without-code-changes.md).
- Requires Docker running. Scans take minutes (`quick`) to hours (`deep`) — run in the background.
- Exit codes (headless): `0` clean, `1` fatal error, `2` vulnerabilities found. A `0` only covers what was analyzed — check `run.json` (`status`, `llm_usage.cost` vs the budget) before calling a run clean.
- Artifacts in `strix_runs/<run-name>/`: `penetration_test_report.md`, `vulnerabilities/*.md`, `vulnerabilities.json`, `findings.sarif` (SARIF 2.1.0), `run.json`.
- Upstream CLI docs (mostly still accurate, but don't cover this fork's additions): https://docs.strix.ai/llms.txt.
- Only scan targets the user is authorized to test.

## Contributing to this repo

- Python 3.12+, managed with `uv`. Install dev deps: `make dev-install`.
- Lint/format/type-check/security, all in one: `make check-all` (ruff, mypy, bandit).
- Tests: `uv run pytest`.
- Run from source: `uv run strix --target <target>`.
- Layout: `strix/agents` (agent graph + prompts), `strix/tools` (proxy, browser, terminal, scanners), `strix/runtime` (Docker sandbox), `strix/report` (findings, SARIF), `strix/skills` (internal knowledge packs the pentest agents load — different from the consumer skills in `skills/`), `strix/interface` (CLI/TUI), `containers/` (sandbox image).
- Pre-commit hooks: `make pre-commit` (or `uv run pre-commit install`).
