        - `dev_mode=false` with an unchanged secret is unambiguous — the
          operator explicitly said this isn't dev mode, so still shipping
          with a public, hardcoded secret can only be an oversight. This
          refuses to start rather than silently running with a
          decryptable credential store / forgeable session cookies.
        - `dev_mode=true` (the default) can't be refused the same way —
          it's also what makes local dev/CI usable with no email provider
          — so this instead prints a startup banner too loud to miss,
          since nothing else in this codebase currently checks it (see
