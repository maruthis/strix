description: Pentest a web app, API, codebase, repository, URL, domain, or IP with Strix — autonomous AI penetration testing that exploits and proves vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10 and beyond — injection, XSS, SSRF, auth/access-control flaws, IDOR, business logic) instead of just flagging them. Runs self-hosted with the open-source CLI in a Docker sandbox, and returns validated findings with proof-of-concept exploits (Markdown, JSON, CSV, SARIF). Use when the user asks to pentest, hack, security-scan, security-audit, or find vulnerabilities in an app, API, website, or repo.

# Run a Strix pentest

Strix runs autonomous AI pentesting agents that dynamically exploit a target and only report findings validated with a working proof-of-concept — self-hosted, on your machine, in a Docker sandbox with your own LLM key. Free, fully local, BYO-LLM, air-gap capable.

## Prerequisites

1. **Docker running** — check with `docker info`. The first scan pulls the sandbox image automatically.
2. **Strix installed** — check with `strix --version`. Install if missing:
   ```bash
   pip install "strix-agent @ git+https://github.com/maruthis/strix"
   # or: uv tool install "strix-agent @ git+https://github.com/maruthis/strix"
   ```
   Installing from this fork (not the upstream `strix-agent` PyPI package) is what
   gets its changes — see [`docs/extending-without-code-changes.md`](../../docs/extending-without-code-changes.md)
   for what's different, including the `standards`/`vulnerabilities` skill catalog
   usable via `--skill <name>` below.
3. **LLM configured** — two environment variables:
   ```bash
   export STRIX_LLM="openai/gpt-5.4"      # any LiteLLM model id (openai/..., anthropic/..., openrouter/...)
   export LLM_API_KEY="<provider api key>"
   ```
   Ask the user for these if unset. Never hardcode or commit keys.

## Running a scan

Always use `-n` (non-interactive/headless) — the default TUI blocks agents. Always set `--max-budget` unless the user says otherwise.

```bash
# Local code (white-box)
strix -n -t ./ --scan-mode standard --max-budget 10

# Deployed app / API (black-box)
strix -n -t https://staging.example.com --max-budget 20

# Repo + deployed app together (best coverage)
strix -n -t https://github.com/org/app -t https://staging.example.com

# Focused testing with credentials or scope hints
strix -n -t https://app.example.com \
  --instruction "Use credentials user@example.com:pass123. Focus on IDOR and auth bypass."

# Large monorepo: bind-mount instead of copying
strix -n --mount ./huge-monorepo
```

Key flags:

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-t, --target` | URL, repo URL, local path, domain, or IP. Repeatable. |
| `-n, --non-interactive` | Headless, exits on completion. Required for agents. |
| `-m, --scan-mode` | `quick` (minutes) / `standard` (~30 min) / `deep` (hours, default). |
| `--instruction` / `--instruction-file` | Credentials, focus areas, scope rules. |
| `--skill NAME` | Preload a skill (repeatable, max 5) — e.g. `--skill owasp_top_10`, `--skill pci_dss` for standards coverage, or `--skill sql_injection` for a deep-dive on one vulnerability class. |
| `--max-budget USD` | Hard LLM spend cap; scan wraps up cleanly at the limit. |
| `--max-turns N` | Per-agent turn cap (default 500). |
| `--resume RUN_NAME` | Resume a prior run from `strix_runs/`. |

Scans take minutes (`quick`) to hours (`deep`). Run them in the background and poll for completion rather than blocking.

### Exit codes (headless)

- `0` — finished with no validated vulnerabilities **in what was analyzed**
- `1` — fatal error (missing env vars, Docker down, bad config)
- `2` — vulnerabilities found

A `0` is not proof of full coverage: if `--max-budget`/`--max-turns` is reached before the scan completes, it wraps up early and still exits `0`. When you need assurance the scan finished, give it enough budget and check `strix_runs/<run>/run.json`: a hard budget stop leaves `status: "stopped"`, but an agent that wrapped up early on a budget *warning* still calls `finish_scan` and records `"completed"` — so also sanity-check the run's cost against `--max-budget` and the report's stated coverage before treating a clean result as full coverage.

### Reading results

Artifacts land in `strix_runs/<run-name>/`:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `penetration_test_report.md` | Executive report — read this first. |
| `vulnerabilities/*.md` | One file per validated finding, with PoC and remediation. |
| `vulnerabilities.json` / `vulnerabilities.csv` | All findings as structured JSON / CSV index. |
| `findings.sarif` | SARIF 2.1.0 for GitHub code scanning / ASPM ingestion. |
| `run.json` | Run metadata, status, targets, usage/cost. |

## Reporting & next steps

Summarize findings by severity (critical/high/medium/low/info) and include the PoC evidence. To remediate and verify fixes, use the **fix-security-vulnerabilities-with-strix** skill. To wire scanning into CI/CD, use the **ci-security-scanning-with-strix** skill.

## Safety

Only scan targets the user owns or is authorized to test — confirm authorization yourself if the target looks like third-party infrastructure.
