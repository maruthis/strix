description: Add security scanning to CI/CD with Strix — GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or any pipeline — so every pull request gets a diff-scoped AI pentest that blocks vulnerable code before it merges, with results as SARIF uploaded to code scanning. Runs the self-hosted open-source CLI as a pipeline step, requiring Docker on the runner and a BYO LLM key. Use when the user asks to add security scanning, SAST/DAST, pentesting, vulnerability checks, or automated security review to their CI pipeline, pre-merge gate, or PR workflow.

# Set up Strix in CI/CD

Run a diff-scoped Strix scan on every PR: only changed files are tested, `quick` mode keeps it fast, and exit code `2` fails the build when validated vulnerabilities are found. Fully in your own infra — free (BYO LLM key), no external account, no runner leaves your environment. Requires Docker on the runner.

## GitHub Actions

Create `.github/workflows/security.yml`:

```yaml
name: Security Scan

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  strix-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0   # required for diff-scope resolution

      - name: Install Strix
        run: pip install "strix-agent @ git+https://github.com/maruthis/strix"

      - name: Run Security Scan
        env:
          STRIX_LLM: ${{ secrets.STRIX_LLM }}
          LLM_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LLM_API_KEY }}
        run: strix -n -t ./ --scan-mode quick --max-budget 10

      # Don't fail open: a run that hits the hard budget stop exits 0 but leaves
      # run.json status "stopped", not "completed". Enforce completion explicitly.
      # This does not catch an agent that wrapped up early on a budget *warning*
      # (it still calls finish_scan and records "completed"), so size the budget.
      - name: Fail unless the scan completed
        run: |
          run_json=$(ls -t strix_runs/*/run.json | head -1)
          status=$(jq -r .status "$run_json")
          if [ "$status" != "completed" ]; then
            echo "Strix run status is '$status' — the scan did not complete (likely budget exhausted). Raise --max-budget." >&2
            exit 1
          fi
```

Then tell the user to add two repository secrets: `STRIX_LLM` (model id, e.g. `openai/gpt-5.4`) and `LLM_API_KEY` (the provider key). Do not create these values yourself.

Notes:
- In CI/headless runs Strix automatically scopes to the PR's changed files (`--scope-mode auto`). If diff resolution fails, keep `fetch-depth: 0` or set `--diff-base` to the PR's actual base branch — use `origin/${{ github.base_ref }}` in GitHub Actions rather than a hard-coded `origin/main`, since repos use different default branches.
- Exit codes: `0` pass, `2` vulnerabilities found (fails the job), `1` setup error.
- The runner needs Docker (default GitHub-hosted Ubuntu runners have it).
- **Size the budget so the scan completes — don't let it fail open.** A `0` exit means "no validated vulnerabilities in what was analyzed"; if `--max-budget` is hit before the diff is fully covered, the scan wraps up early and can still exit `0`. The "Fail unless the scan completed" step above narrows the gap: `strix_runs/<run>/run.json` is `"stopped"` when the scan was cut off at the hard budget limit without a final report. It is not a complete guard — the agents get graduated wrap-up warnings before that limit, and a run that wraps up on a warning still calls `finish_scan` and records `"completed"` with partial coverage. So keep that step in any pipeline that gates merges **and** give the scan real headroom (compare `run.json`'s `llm_usage.cost` against `--max-budget`; if it ran right up to the cap, raise it). For a `quick` diff-scoped PR scan `--max-budget 10` is usually ample, raise it for large diffs.

### Optional: upload findings to GitHub code scanning

Strix writes SARIF 2.1.0 to `strix_runs/<run>/findings.sarif`:

```yaml
      - name: Upload SARIF
        if: always()
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
        with:
          sarif_file: strix_runs
```

## Other CI systems

Any pipeline works the same way — install, set the two env vars, run headless:

```bash
pip install "strix-agent @ git+https://github.com/maruthis/strix"
# Resolve the PR's base branch robustly (use your CI's base-branch variable if it
# has one, e.g. GitHub Actions: origin/${{ github.base_ref }}). Avoid piping the
# git lookup into another command — a failed lookup would otherwise be masked.
BASE_BRANCH="${CI_MERGE_REQUEST_TARGET_BRANCH_NAME:-}"   # GitLab MR target
if [ -z "$BASE_BRANCH" ]; then
  BASE_BRANCH=$(git symbolic-ref --quiet --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null)
  BASE_BRANCH="${BASE_BRANCH#origin/}"
fi
DIFF_BASE="origin/${BASE_BRANCH:-main}"
# Fail loudly rather than silently narrowing scope (e.g. to HEAD~1, which on a
# multi-commit branch would scan only the last commit and let earlier ones pass).
if ! git rev-parse --verify --quiet "$DIFF_BASE" >/dev/null; then
  echo "Cannot resolve diff base '$DIFF_BASE'. Fetch the base branch (git fetch origin <base>) or set --diff-base explicitly." >&2
  exit 1
fi
strix -n -t ./ --scan-mode quick --scope-mode diff --diff-base "$DIFF_BASE" --max-budget 10
```

Gate the pipeline on the exit code (see the budget/fail-open caveat above — give the scan enough budget to finish). Schedule `standard` scans nightly and `deep` scans for release candidates.

Installing from `git+https://github.com/maruthis/strix` (rather than the upstream
`strix-agent` PyPI package) is what gets this fork's changes — see
[`docs/extending-without-code-changes.md`](../../docs/extending-without-code-changes.md).
